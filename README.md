# Movie-Recommender-System
This is a hollywood movie recommender system built with Python. I used IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset to built this.

# Files Brief
In the preprocessing.ipynb file the Data Preprocessing part has been done. 

In the create.py file I created two files for future uses one data.csv and other a numpy matrix.

The application is run from the main.py file.
